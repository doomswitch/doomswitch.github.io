- disable focus buttons while game is being played?
- number tweaking
- change numerical value on personal stats to percentage bars?
- revisit 500 as the magic bucket number in win rate calc
- e.v. for mmr
--- random mmr opponents
- mmr decay while not playing
- sell account
- interval map so we can support multiple bars going at once if we need it (maybe wait until we need it)
